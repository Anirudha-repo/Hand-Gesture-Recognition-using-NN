# Hand Gesture Recognition using Neural Networks

This project focuses on recognizing hand gestures using neural networks. The process involves:

- **Data Collection**: Gathering a dataset of hand gesture images.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the images for training.
- **Model Architecture**: Designing a neural network model with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Dense layers for classification.
- **Training**: Training the model on the dataset and optimizing performance.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's accuracy using metrics like confusion matrix and classification report.
- **Deployment**: Implementing the trained model in a real-time application to recognize hand gestures from live video feeds.

This project leverages neural networks to create an efficient and accurate hand gesture recognition system.
